# AutoIt-Script-for-Clicking

An AutoIt script that performs multiple left clicks every time you click the left mouse button. The script stops as soon as you press the * (star) key on the numeric keypad.

I use it to play shouter games, he help me with pistol and rifle, and Anti Cheates (like EasyAntyCheat) can't detect it

enjoy
